This is a collection of libraries for Go to read JCR6 files and other formats JCR6 should be able to read.

Writing will only be possible in the JCR6 file, all other files will be considered "read-only"

The libraries have been set up for ultimate simplicity. This may cut some possibilities that are normal for Go file management, but it makes stuff by far more easier to do in JCR6 and more stable too. 

My first aim is to make sure the libraries work at all, later on some extra stability, error catching and performance issues may be addressed.
