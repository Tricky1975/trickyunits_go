![JCR6](https://github.com/Tricky1975/trickyunits_go/raw/master/jcr6/JCR.PNG?raw=true)

This is a collection of libraries for Go to read JCR6 files and other formats JCR6 should be able to read.

Writing will only be possible in the JCR6 file, all other files will be considered "read-only"

The libraries have been set up for ultimate simplicity. This may cut some possibilities that are normal for Go file management, but it makes stuff by far more easier to do in JCR6 and more stable too. 

My first aim is to make sure the libraries work at all, later on some extra stability, error catching and performance issues may be addressed.



# NOTE!
Contrary to the other libraries in this repository JCR6 is licensed under the MPL.
JCR6 itself is open-source, and for now I intend to keep it open source.
The MPL does allow JCR6 to be merged in closed sourced projects as long as the source of JCR6 itself remains public and modified versions should be published. The code of the non-JCR6 source files may remain closed under all circumstances!
