# Tricky Units - GO

This repository will serve to host my own Go units.
Please note that this is something I am still experimenting with.
Prior to starting this repository I never coded in the Go Language before, so everything you see here is for now part of a learning curve for me.
Cloning this repository is fine with me, but don't expect anything from it while it's still in its experimental stage.
I don't recommend using anything here, until this note about experimentation is gone.

For the license, I'll say everything is zLib licensed unless there's a license block in the code stating otherwise.

If you clone any repositories from me of projects written in go, please note that in the workspace repository the folder in which all this stuff is located must be named "trickyunits" (I don't know if it matters in Windows, but on unix based systems it will be very important to have that name in LOWER CASE).
